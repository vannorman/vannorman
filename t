I am an entrepreneur, game developer, full stack web developer, and educator, with a passion for VR, AR, and AI.
	 Virtual and Augmented Reality 
		From mind-bending new games and stories to highly effective enterprise applications, I absolutely love the space and am always busy in it. 
	 Artificial Intelligence 
		AI can greatly augment and accelerate the creation process. One of my deepest dreams is to train computers to reduce developer time to create an application eventually, to zero.
	 Tools  Over the years I have organized a wealth of modules and utilities. Today I can snap together applications in a fraction of the time it once took with every new project comes the eagerness to forge another tool for my collection.
	 Education  Here is my ideal school: student directed, projected based, games and programming focused. We will promote a growth mindset and a culture of abundance, and we will tightly couple learning and classroom activities with industry and revenue in the real world.
